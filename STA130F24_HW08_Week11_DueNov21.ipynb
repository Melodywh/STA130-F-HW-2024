    "Indeed, STA130 Homework essentially boils down to completing various understanding confirmation exercises oriented around coding and writing tasks.\n",

There are differences of course, such as how there is **coefficient hypothesis testing** in **multiple linear regression** and **confusion matrices** in **classification decision trees**, and so on.

Thus overall \"criterion\" noted above improves with each new **decision node splitting rule**, so the improvement can thus be tracked and the improvement contributions attributed to the **feature** upon which the **decision node splitting rule** is based.

But the so-called **feature importance** heuristics allows us to judge how relatively important the overall contributions from different features are in the final decision tree predictions. Now we just need to be sure we're not **overfitting** our **classification decision trees** since they can be so **complex**. Fortunately, the \"GridSearchCV\" methodology mentioned in regards to finding the best `max_depth` setting for a tree is going to provide a general answer to the challenge of complexity and **overfitting** in **machine learning models** that is not too hard to understand (and which you might already have some guesses or a hunch about). \n",
